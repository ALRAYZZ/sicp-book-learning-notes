To evaluate a combination whose operator names a compound procedure,
 the interpreter follows much the same process as for combinations
  whose operators name primitive procedures, which we described
   in 1.1.3. That is, the interpreter evaluates the elements
    of the combination and applies the procedure
     (which is the value of the operator of the combination)
      to the arguments (which are the values of the operands 
      of the combination).
